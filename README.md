# Airplanes Crashes Study
## _Accidents and Incidents from 1908 to 2023_


- Aggregated data sources:
  - Accidents and Incidents data: http://www.planecrashinfo.com/database.htm
  - Geo Location data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft

The Accidents and Incidents on the dataset are: 
- All civil and commercial aviation accidents of scheduled and non-scheduled passenger airliners worldwide, which resulted in a fatality (including all U.S. Part 121 and Part 135 fatal accidents)
- All cargo, positioning, ferry and test flight fatal accidents.
- All military transport accidents with 10 or more fatalities.
- All commercial and military helicopter accidents with greater than 10 fatalities.
- All civil and military airship accidents involving fatalities.
- Aviation accidents involving the death of famous people.
- Aviation accidents or incidents of noteworthy interest.

**Midair collisions are aggredated by "/" for example, Aircraft 1 / Aircraft 2** 

**Location of Events are approximated, from the dataset, only 13,58% is known**

## Methodogy

- Data Scraped from http://www.planecrashinfo.com/database.htm
- Data extracted cleaned and reorganized
- Geo Location Data scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft
- Geo Data appended to the main dataset
- Due to multiple spelling errors from the original source, manual cleaning had to be in Excel
- Exploratory Analyses performed to assist in Data Visualisation
- Dashboard Creation
